# RNN and ConvRNN Implementations in PyTorch

## Overview
This repository provides from-scratch implementations in PyTorch for various types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including:

- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Convolutional GRU (ConvGRU)

Each model is designed to be easy to understand and extend, making this a useful resource for learning and experimentation with RNN architectures in PyTorch.
